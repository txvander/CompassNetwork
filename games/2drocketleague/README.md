## Design

The general design approach taken for Rocket League 2D (RL2d) started with a focus on the minimum viable product (MVP). Coding basic features such as movement, collision detection, basic physics, scoring, and a timer was the first goal. 

Once a MVP had been completed, some advanced features such as sound effects, car models, and refined collision physics could be completed.

RL2d development emphasized throwbacks to the original game on Ps4/Xbox One/PC. Sound effects come straight from Rocket League's sound files, and the aesthetic design was based on the aesthetics of the original Rocket League.
