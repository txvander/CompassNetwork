:ruv:I would be too tired to do these kind of stuff, but...
:ruv:angry:...I have to do what I'm meant to do.
:ruv:upset:I'd say break a leg but I might end up breaking yours literally and I'm going to make this as painful as possible for you...
:ruv:upset:...and your little girlfriend.
:bf:sad::loud:!!!
